	TODO Features:
- AAF releases
- Capitalise everything behind the - in a scene release (in case of a unknown group)
	- Autoadd unknown group ?
- Search and Replace system on outputfilenames
	- Maybe with $N for name, $S for season, $E for episode, $T for title, $C for sceneinfo
- Make EDIT popup grab the origional filename when the new filename is empty.xxxxx.empty (eg, unknown).

	BUGS:
- american.dad.S05E11.HDTV.XviD-fever.avi
- multiple Empty.SXXEXX.empty files
- Battlestar.Galactica.S02E01.Scattered.ws.XviD-TCM (problem with ws beeing 2 chars and / or not getting quality
- ncis gets renamed to Ncis instead of NCIS -> might have to include this in TVrage api to get proper caps on showname.

	DONE:
- EDIT output filenames -> Rclick in outputbox on filename to bring it up.
